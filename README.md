Once smart contract is live, go to comfyeggs.com.

## Minting access
Connect your MetaMask hotwallet by clicking CONNECT.
If whitelist minting is live and you are on the whitelist (ERC20/hot wallet address added to whitelist achieved by completing tasks on our Discord), you will be able to mint early (as per contract owner's release) up to 5 Comfy Egg NFTs

Once whitelist minting is closed, public minting will be shortly released (mint up to 20 Comfy Egg NFTs per address for 0.02 ETH each)

## View on OpenSea Testnet 
Once you mint your Comfy Egg NFT, you can view it on your profile on the OpenSea Testnet. The unique Comfy Egg you receive will be revealed after the minting process is complete. In the meantime, everyone will see the same default image as their NFT as shown here:

Once the revealing process begins, it will look something like this:

Some traits like the super-hero-looking egg are rare. Others, not so much.
